# Code Challenge

## The challenge is to build:
- A calculator service that consist of the bowling logic (Backend. If doing frontend only make this service in frontend only) This service can can have a function like function calculate(currentRoll: Roll, historicRolls: array of Rolls)
- A view to fill in all the bowling values (Frontend)
- Atleast one stateless component (Frontend)
- Proper interfaces and types (Frontend and Backend)

- For this challenge I chose to work with JavaScript using Vue as my frontend framework. 
- I had never used Vue before but I wanted to push myself
